SELECT * FROM [tablename];

SELECT [col1],[col2],... FROM [tablename];

SELECT * FROM [tablename] WHERE [colname] = [value];
// returns rows of matching value
//ex. SELECT * FROM family_members WHERE species = 'human';
// "=" can be replace with any other boolean expression

SELECT * FROM [tbname] WHERE [expression] AND [expression2]
// AND statement adds multiple expression
// OR statement applicable 

SELECT * FROM [tbname] WHERE [col] IN ([val1], [val2])
// IN statement allows for multiple values search 
// returns rows with val1 and val2 in col 
// NOT IN statement applicable

SELECT DISTINCT [col] FROM [tbname] WHERE [expression]
//returns rows without duplicates 

SELECT * FROM [tbname] ORDER BY [col];
//ORDER BY statement sorts rows based on col. Ascending is default
//Add DESC at end of statement for descending sort
